Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients(also an object) and returns the 
maximum number of cakes can bake. For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g 1lb of flour or 200g of suagr are 
simply 1 or 200). Ingrediants that are not present in the objects, can be considred as 0.

cakes({flour: 500, sugar: 200, eggs:1}, {flour: 1200, sugar: 1200, eggs:5, milk: 200})  // 2

cakes({apples:3, flour: 300, sugar: 150, milk: 100, oil: 100}, {sugar: 500, flour: 2000,  milk: 2000})  // 0
