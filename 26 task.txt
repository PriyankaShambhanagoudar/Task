 We have two arrays, and we want to see what the result of adding the numbers that only show up in one of them.

       addDiff([1,2,3],[2,3,4]) === 5;

       addDiff([-3,2,2,5,6],[1,5,6,7]) === 9;

       addDiff([],[2,3]) === 5;

       addDiff([3,2,4],[]) === 9;

       addDiff([3,2,4],[3,2,4]) === 0;
