                  ByteCorp is a famous technology company. The CEO of ByteCorp doesn't trust anyone and thinks that his accountant managed to move huge amounts of money to a competitor company, Megacorp. He hires a computer crime investigator, and asks him to find inconsistencies in the money transfers.
          
                  Here is a sample transaction log of the comapny:
                  Feb SLR 4 M
                  Feb ENT 800 K
                  Mar SLR 4000 K
                  Mar ENT 800 K
                  Apr SLR 4010 K
                  Apr ENT 810 K
          
                  There are four coloumns:
                  1. Month of the transaction
                  2. Reason of the expense (SLR for "salary", ENT for "entertainment", OTR for "other")
                  3. Amount
                  4. M, K or B (M for million, K for thousands, B for billion)
          
                  In the example above, April expenses show an inconsistency and should be reported.
          
                  Another example:
                  Jul SLR 4 M
                  Jul ENR 800 K
                  Jul OTR 1200 K
                  Aug SLR 4000 K
                  Aug ENR 800 K
                  Aug OTR 1190 K
                  Sep SLR 4000 K
                  Sep ENR 800 K
                  Sep OTR 1190 K
          
                  Here, July expenses show an inconsistency and should be reported..
          
                  As the computer investigator, write a program, which reads the transcation logs, detects inconsistent expenses and prints the exact month containing the "unusual" activities.
